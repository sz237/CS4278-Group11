Vanderbilt CS 4278 Team 11 Software Engineering Project

## Project Summary
It is a commonly referenced struggle that, upon graduating and moving to an unfamiliar city, it is hard to find people with commonalities to connect with. Plus One aims to help alleviate that issue by platforming new Vanderbilt graduates in one accessible spot so that people with this common background can reach out to one another. Through this process, people can make friendships, find a roommate, share work and internship opportunities, and even find a friend to join for a day trip. 

Plus One provides a variety of tools and user experiences to help Vanderbilt alumni connect with each other. In our app, graduates will complete a profile onboarding experience then be directed to a discovery page which they can access at any time to see activities and events in their area being posted. Our app incorporates search functionality and filtering mechanisms so that users can find other alumni with common interests. The scope of the project, ultimately, is to provide Vandy alumni with one central platform to casual connections beyond graduation.
